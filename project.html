        <h2>Why Meal Plan?</h2>
        <h6>(the problem)</h6>
        <p>
          As a typical household member, I found myself really struggling between finding my favorite recipes, coordinating with my partner in planning the weekly meals, putting together a grocery list and finally doing the grocery shopping. This daunting and time-consuming process oftentimes leads us to eat out more often than we want to and not sticking to the healthy diet we strive for.  Soon I learned that just like me, other people have similar struggles as well.

        <h2>Gaining understanding</h2>
        <h6>(Ux Research)</h6>
        <p>
          Building a Meal Plan app just for my needs is good enough of an excuse however, I needed to make sure this project would be also helpful to many other users.  In order to design a product that would help many users, I performed an extensive user experience research.

          <h3>Surveys</h3>
          <p>
            I conducted a survery to learn abou the dynamics of grocery shopping and meal making and planning.  Here is what I learned:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>83%</span>

            <li>
              <span>66%</span>
              <span>Respondents said they don't use any meal planning or grocery list tool</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>45%</span>
              <span>Respondents said that time, cooking at home and planning ahead helps them stiking to a healthy diet</span>

          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>
            To gain a deeper understanding of my users, I chatted with 3 participants from various backgrounds.  This gave me perspective about their motivations and frustrations  
          </p>
          <ul>

          <h2>What the others are doing</h2>
          <h6>(competitive analysis)</h6>
          <p>
            Recipe apps are not a new thing, in fact, there are many applications out there that would offer a combination of features.  From my research, I picked two strongest competitors, Yummily and Mealime. and performed a SWOT.  I learned that both apps have great strengths, however, I could see a lot of potential for Meal Plan.

        <h3>Branding & identity</h3>
        <p>
          To find Meal Plan's identity, I first jot down the feelings Meal Plan wanted to evoke.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>warmth</li>
          <li>homey</li>
          <li>trust</li>
          <li>clarity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then I went into drawing; I lead my mind free to explore...</p>
        <img src='images/logo-sketches.png' alt='logo drawing exploration' />
        <p>Finally, I chose the name and logo.... and gavie it color</p>
        <img src='images/logo black.png' alt='black and white logo' />
        <img src='images/logo-standard.png' alt='colorized logo' />
        <section>
          <img src='images/colors.png' alt='color palette'/>
          <p>I chose light background to give the app a sense of cleanness and order</p> 
          <p>The primary color is orange because is often represented for food and also adds some warmth and fun into the app.</p>
          <p>As a secondary color, I used this tone of blue since it contrasts well with orange and also adds to the clean look.</p>
        </section>
        <p>To put all those beautiful ideas together and guide the app as it progresses, I made a style board.</p>

        <h4>Information Architecture..</h4>
        <article>
          <h5>User Stories, Content Strategy & User Flow</h5>
          <p>
            With the new information from my research findings, I was able to move forward onto the information architecture phase.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h5>User Stories</h5>
          <p>
            By doing user stories, I was able to prioritize the features I should first work on Meal Plan.  Since I gather a lot of great ideas for features I could incorporate in Meal Plan, prioritizing on the MVP, helped me focus.

        <h3>From Sketches to Wireframes</h3>
        <p>With the MVP and user flows in place, I then move on to sketching.  Once I was happy with one desing, I created wireframes using Figma.</p>

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          Meal Plan was a fun project to work on.  This mockup project covers the basic features, however, this app is designed to grow to include a lot more helpful tools.  Along the process, I learned a lot about how to design a project from identifying a problem to design.  The biggest take away would be the importance of testing; It’s essential to include the perspective from the users, so this app can work for everyone.
