          data-description="Meal Plan was a fun project to work on.  This mockup project covers the basic features, however, this app is designed to grow to include a lot more helpful tools.  Along the process, I learned a lot about how to design a project from identifying a problem to design.  The biggest take away would be the importance of testing; It's essential to include the perspective from the users, so this app can work for everyone."/>
