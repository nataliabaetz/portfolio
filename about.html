          data-description="A am a UX/UI Designer based in San Francisco.  I love designing simple but yet intentional products that would make a positive impact on society and the world.  Growing up in Mexico I was always drawn to creativity.  On my first job as a teen, I took the lead to design digital and print promotional flyers for the furniture store I worked for, early on I knew I wanted a career in the design industry.  In 2006, my love for travel and curiosity for learning about different cultures, lead me to move to the Bay Area where my journey of creative possibilities began to really flourish.  In college, I put my creativity into practice when leading the marketing committee for the honor society I was part of.  While attending college, I started a family photography business where my main focus was on capturing the right moments to evoke the right feelings.  I also co-lead several big-group events with creative themes where my biggest goal was to make the attendees' experiences something they will remember for a long time.  In the digital world, I'm fortunate to be able to touch and impact many people's lives.  Using my creative skills and attention for detail, I strive to design products having the users' emotions and experiences at the forefront.">
