      As a typical household member, I found myself really struggling between finding my favorite recipes, coordinating with my partner in planning the weekly meals, putting together a grocery list and finally doing the grocery shopping. This daunting and time-consuming process oftentimes leads us to eat out more often than we want to and not sticking to the healthy diet we strive for.  Soon I learned that just like me, other people have similar struggles as well.
